# Democratic v. Not Democratic: Corruption Perceived and Income Inequality
During this project, I tried to answer the following research question: "Is it true that in more democratic countries, less corruption is perceived?" using freely available datasets and developing data visualisations to show my findings. 

The Datasets I will use in the project are:
- CPI Rate: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeegarmaru/corruption-perceptions-index-for-10-years
- Age of electoral Democracy: https://ourworldindata.org/democracy

The first one reports the CPI Score for many world countries from 2010 to 2019. **The Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI)** is an index which ranks countries "by their perceived levels of public sector corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion surveys. The CPI Score is based on a scale from 0 to 100 and the **higher the Score, the lower corruption is perceived**in the country. These data are published annually by the organisation **Transparency International**. The second dataset shows if a country is considered a **electoral democracy** from 1800 to 2019.**Electoral democracy** is intended as a political system that holds **meaningful, free, fair, and multi-party elections.**

## My Conclusions
From the data I analysed and visualised, I can say that a correlation is highly possible and democratic countries generally show less perceived corruption. But there is some exception that undermines this certainty and does not allow me to say with one hundred per cent certainty that the CPI Score is dependent on the democratic situation of the country. However, I can say that generally, democracy positively influences the CPI score. As we can see in the fourth visualisation, democratic countries occupy all the top positions in 2019 for CPI score, and the trend shown by the first visualisation is clear: democratic countries generally score higher than not democratic ones.
